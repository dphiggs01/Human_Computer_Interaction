# Human Computer Interaction

The Papers in this repository were produced while taking the graduate
course in [HCI](http://omscs6750.gatech.edu/) at GA Tech during the
Spring of 2019.


Assignments [M4](./Project_Work/Assignment-M4.pdf), [M5](./Project_Work/Assignment-M5.pdf) and the [Final Project](./Project_Work/Assignment_M_Final_Report.pdf) were selected as *Exemplary*
work among a 400+ cohort class. These project papers are now used in the next
generation of the course to help new students with example projects to
assimilate the material taught into meaningful project artifacts.

If you are interested you can take the course [Human Computer Interaction](https://www.udacity.com/course/human-computer-interaction--ud400)
on Udacity for free.

### A brief outline of the course
Taken from the Course Outline [Learning Goals and Outcomes](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6750-human-computer-interaction)

There are three broad **learning goals** for this course. At the end of
this course, you will understand:

* The principles and characteristics of human-computer interaction, such
as direct manipulation, usability affordances, and interaction design
heuristics.

* The workflow for designing and evaluating user-centered designs, from
needfinding to prototyping to evaluation.

* The current state of research and development in human-computer
interaction, such as augmented reality, wearable devices, and robotics.

Connected to those three learning goals are three **learning outcomes**. The learning outcomes are subsumed under the general learning outcome, "To design effective interactions between humans and computers". At the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Design user interfaces and experiences grounded in known principles of
usability and human-computer interaction.

* Iteratively prototype, evaluate, and improve user-centered designs
with user feedback.

* Apply those skills to open or new areas of development in
human-computer interaction.

### The Design of Everyday Things

Another excellent and complimentary course which I took at the same time as this course is
[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-the-design-of-everyday-things--design101).
This course is also available for free on Udacity.
